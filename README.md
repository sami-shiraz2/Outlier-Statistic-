# Outlier:
The dataset that is distinct from all other observation, in other words we can say that dataset that is not belongs to the present observation.

# Technique of finding Outlier in the dataset,
1) Z-Score
2) IQR

# Z-Score:
X-mean/std

# IQR:
75% - 25%

In Above code, I have given a example to find outliers in dataset..
